### What I learned

So i kinda struggle with the image at first cause i thought it was an svg and that made thing difficult 
but i realised i didnÂ´t to use the svg i can use an img tag and it worked perfectly. Also thanks to the last project i got best in using postioning to center the content and this time i added Flexbox. like the last project i had to try a lot of value for the width, height, padding, and margin before i can get the right one
Lastly this is my first time officially working with box shadow i`ve had a few class on it but this is the the first time writing it in my code and i loved how it turned out 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.main-container {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    width: 310px;
    height: 480px;
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-radius: 15px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    box-shadow: 6px 5px 3px 1px rgba(
        0, 0, 0, 0.9);
}

.main-container > .sub-container > .profile > img {
    width: 40px;
    margin-right: 10px;
    float: left;
}

span {
    font-family: "Figtree", serif;
    font-weight: 700;
    margin-top: 10px;
    float: left;
}
```

### Continued development

i will focusing on how to get the right value in terms of px and % also how to align contents better 
how to use Flexbox in place of float and to add favicon.
